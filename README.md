My Website

Please note that this site was mostly written in 2019, and, even then, I wasn't trying to make a site to show off my web dev skillz. I am planning to rewrite this.

Also don't look directly at the divs. They outnumber you, but they can't hurt you! They're more afraid of you than you are of them. No, no, don't look at the classes either. Stop looking at the code please. ;_;
