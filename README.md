# SharonLougheed.github.io
My Website

Please note that this site was mostly written in 2019, and, even then, I wasn't trying to make a site to show off my web dev skillz. I will be working on it more this year, so please stay tuned. And by "stay tuned", I mean... please put "Check out sharonlougheed.com" on your Google Calendar or whatever for say... November 1, 2024. And uh... put another one for December 1. Please. ;_; Hopefully I'll get around to rewriting/updating this site by then.

Also don't look directly at the divs. They outnumber you, but they can't hurt you! They're more afraid of you than you are of them. No, no, don't look at the classes either. Stop looking at the code please. ;_;
